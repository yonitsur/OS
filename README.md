# client/server architecture
Clients connect to the server and send it a stream of bytes. The server counts how
many of the bytes are printable and returns that number to the client. The server also maintains
overall statistics on the number of printable characters it has received from all clients. When the
server terminates, it prints these statistics to standard output.
